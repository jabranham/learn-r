Participants are asked to install R (and, optionally, Rstudio) before the course begins. If you are completely new to R (or if it's been a while since you used it and you want a refresher), please also complete the pre-class exercises as well.

Installation of R, the material covered in the pre-class exercises, and a basic familiarity with statistics will be assumed.

* Software
** R
Participants are requested to install R (and, optionally, Rstudio) before the course begins. R is free and open-source software. Instructions for installing R can be found [[https://cloud.r-project.org/][online]]. The latest release as of 2017-04-21 is R version 3.4.0.
** R Editor
Most users will want to install Rstudio, a free and open-source R IDE ("integrated development environment").[fn:1] Navigate to www.rstudio.com and follow instructions for your operating system to download the open source version.
* Pre-class exercises
- [[http://tryr.codeschool.com/levels/1/challenges/1][Try R]] :: Provides a nice introduction to using R. The length of time it takes depends on how familiar you are with R, but it should take no longer than an hour.
* Additional resources
None of this is required before the course begins, but all of it is useful:
** Short content
- [[https://thepoliticalmethodologist.com/2013/11/25/making-high-resolution-graphics-for-academic-publishing/][Making High Resolution Graphics for Academic Publishing]] :: Great walkthrough of the details on how to produce graphics for publication from R and Stata.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] If you are already using a text editor like Emacs, Vim, Atom, or Sublime Text, there are also packages that make R work well inside those editors.
